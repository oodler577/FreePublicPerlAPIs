# Rules && Guidelines

This is supposed to be easy and fun!

1. Make sure [the API you select](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) at not been [claimed](https://github.com/oodler577/FreePublicPerlAPIs/wiki)
2. Make sure to s[elect an API that is FREE](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) from [https://www.freepublicapis.com/](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) and **API must require NO authentication mechanism**
3. A complete entry consists of at least 1 Perl module and 1 commandline client with commands to use all API endpoints
4. Complete POD is required. POD is not required, but it must render in `
5. Installing the module must also install the client (so it's available via `PATH`) _and_ all dependencies.
6. Dist::Zilla is strongly recommended, so please include any [dist.ini](https://metacpan.org/release/OODLER/Acme-Free-API-Stonks-1.0.0/source/dist.ini) (see [example](https://metacpan.org/release/OODLER/Acme-Free-API-Stonks-1.0.0/source/dist.ini)) in your CPAN upload!
7. ALL endpoints of the API must be implemented and used in some way by the cli client
8. You must [claim your API](https://github.com/oodler577/FreePublicPerlAPIs/wiki) before you start working on it
9. There are no deadlines, but if your claim is clearly stale it can be scooped
10. NO `TRIAL` module uploaded to CPAN
11. Versions must start at `1.0.0` or _very near_ that if you anticipate some changes
12. Modules must be _complete_ (hence the preference for `1.0.0`
13. Modules and cli client must be _zero conf_ (no configuration files required)
