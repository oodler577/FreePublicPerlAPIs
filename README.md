# Rules && Guidelines

This is supposed to be easy and fun!

1. Make sure [the API you select](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) at not been [claimed](https://github.com/oodler577/FreePublicPerlAPIs/wiki)
2. Make sure to s[elect an API that is FREE](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) from [https://www.freepublicapis.com/](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) and requires NO authentication mechanism
3. A complete entry consists of at least 1 Perl module and 1 commandline client with commands to use all API endpoints
4. Installing the module must also install the client (so it's available via `PATH`)
5. ALL endpoints of the API must be implemented and used in some way by the cli client
6. You must claim your API before you start working on it
7. There are no deadlines, but if your claim is clearly stale it can be scooped
